# Terraform Workshop 
# Introduction #
Welcome to Hands on Workshop! Are you bored with managing your cloud environment via Cloud portal? Are you tired with clicking icons repeatedly in Cloud portal to create resources?  Then it is the workshop you should try. This workshop will give you some different kind of experience for handling Cloud Resources. 
In this workshop we are not going to touch web portal, instead we learn and manage all the Cloud resources through Code, i.e Infrastructure As A Code. We are going to create cloud components/resources through Terraform script. We will discuss in detail about Terraform scripting for each Cloud resource and then we shall learn about creating an Instance in OCI with all dependent resources through Terraform.
